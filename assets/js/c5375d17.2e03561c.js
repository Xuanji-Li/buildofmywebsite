It is the interface provided to the user and is the shell of the program.\n2) The bottom layer is the core "data layer" (Model), that is, the data or information that the program needs to manipulate.\n(3) The middle layer is the Controller, which is responsible for selecting the data in the Data Layer according to the user\'s input from the View Layer, and then manipulating it accordingly to produce the final result.\nThese three layers are closely linked but independent of each other, with changes within each layer not affecting the others.

Each layer performs a different function and the structure of the program is very clear.\nIf we expand our imagination a little, we can see that many programs are essentially in this mode: they provide a set of external triggers (in this case, buttons), then perform some internal operations and finally return the result.

In the simplest case, the microwave oven is operated by two dials, one controlling the temperature and the other the time. These two dials are the 'view' layer, while the microwave generator inside is the 'data' layer (Model), where 'data' needs to be understood as 'core functionality'. The control layer is used to translate the information entered by the user via the dial into an operation of the microwave generator.\nIf each layer is independent, then a new, trendy casing on the outside of the microwave oven, or a more powerful microwave generator on the inside, can be implemented without changing the other layers.

One part is the warehouse, responsible for providing goods, which is the 'functional layer' (or 'data layer'); the other part is the retail shop, responsible for selling goods, which is its 'appearance layer'; and in between is the 'mechanism layer', which includes all the mechanisms for interaction between the counter and the warehouse.\nWith this distinction, the structure of the mall becomes very clear and can be optimised for the different layers to improve efficiency."))))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
